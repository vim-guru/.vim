Vim run-command
===============

I spend a whole lot of time editing text, so it's important to have
efficient tooling for the job. `Vim` alone is pretty good, but it can really
shine with some enhancements.

Give it a spin

I've chosen to write a little about my configuration to remember why I made
certain choices etc. I've done so alongside the configuration itself, so
there's actually a compile-step involved. That means you'll need
[lit](https://github.com/cdosborn/lit), but ones that is installed,
everything else is handled by the configuration itself.
Just fork & clone this repository and run:
```sh
lit ~/.vim/*.lit && ln -s rc.vim ~/.vimrc
```
